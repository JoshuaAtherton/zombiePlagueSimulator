        <ul>
          <li>Black circles are healthy survivors</li>
          <li>Red circles are infected zombies</li>
          <li>Survivors have to gather food to remain alive. If they fail to gather food
          their health is decrease. If their health is less than or equal to zero they
          become a zombie.</li>
          <li>Zombies will chase survivors to infect them. But there are also resistance
          pockets that have come up with a cure. Because of this their is a small
          chance that a zombie can become a survivor again, with the condition that
          they now only have 50 percent health.</li>
          <li>Simulation starts with one infected zombie that infects other people and turns them
          into zombies when touched.</li>
