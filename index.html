      <ul>
        <li>Controls: Sit back and watch or click to spawn a hunter, rightclick to spawn a zombie.</li>
        <li>Black circles: healthy survivors</li>
        <li>Red circles: infected zombies</li>
        <li>Green circles: infected zombies whos legs have fallen off</li>
        <li>Blue circles: zombie hunter</li>
        <li>Survivors have to gather food to remain alive. If they fail to gather food
          their health is decreased. If their health is less than or equal to zero they
          become a zombie.</li>
        <li>Zombies only can chase survivors for so long before the difficulties of death
          hinder them....by their legs fallin off</li>
        <li>Zombies durability goes up when infecting a survivor. If a zombies durability
          meter runs out their legs fall off making them stationary
          and they turn green to be slowly culled from the world by the resistance. </li>
        <li>Zombies will chase survivors to infect them. But there are also resistance
          pockets that have come up with a cure. Because of this there is a small
          chance that a zombie can become a survivor again, with the condition that
          they now only have 50 percent health, have a smaller field of vision, and
          this cure is only available while there are more survivors than zombies.</li>
        <li>Blue zombie hunter is supported by the survivors. If zombie population becomes greater than
          the survivor population, survivors stop feeding the lazy zombie hunter and he takes damage. If
          his health drops below zero he becomes a zombie.</li>
        <li>Simulation starts with infected zombies that infects survivors and turn them
          into zombies when touched and a zombie hunter that kills zombies.</li>
