      <h3>Description: </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Black circles are healthy survivors</li>
        <li>Red circles are infected zombies</li>
        <li>Blue circle is the zombie hunter</li>
        <li>Survivors have to gather food to remain alive. If they fail to gather food
          their health is decreased. If their health is less than or equal to zero they
          become a zombie.</li>
        <li>Zombies only can chase survivors for so long before the difficulties of death
          hinder them....</li>
        <li>Zombies durability goes up when infecting a survivor. If a zombies durability
          meter runs out their legs fall off making them stationary
          and they turn green to be slowly culled from the world by the resistance. </li>
        <li>Zombies will chase survivors to infect them. But there are also resistance
          pockets that have come up with a cure. Because of this there is a small
          chance that a zombie can become a survivor again, with the condition that
          they now only have 50 percent health and have a smaller field of vision.</li>
        <li>Simulation starts with one infected zombie that infects other people and turns them
          into zombies when touched, and one zombie hunter.</li>
